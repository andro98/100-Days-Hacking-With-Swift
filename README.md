# 100-Days-Hacking-With-Swift
## What tooks my attention in Days 1- 15
<ul>
  <li>Enums with associated values</li>
  <li>Range operators (..., ..<)</li>
  <li>Switch statements in swift, where in other programming language we need to write "break" for each case, in swift only the case we want it to continue to the next one, we write "fallthrough"</li>
  <li>Labeled Statements, where you can break from nested loop using label name of the outer loop</li>
  <li>Argument Labels and Parameter Names, the argument label is used when calling the function, the parameter name is used in the implementation of the function.</li>
  <li>How closures capture values, this can help to know how many times this closure has been called</li>
  <li>Computed property, where you compute the value of a property based on the value of another one on initialization</li>
  <li>Property observer, where you can do logic before a variable starts to changes, and every time it changes</li>
  <li>When you declare a class as being final, no other class can inherit from it.</li>
  <li>Classes donâ€™t enforce constants as strongly as structs, if a property is declared as a variable, it can be changed regardless of how the class instance was created</li>
  <li>Extensions add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type. This includes the ability to extend types for which you do not have access to the original source code</li>
  <li>Protocols are Interfaces in swift</li>
  <li>Failable initializer, where we can return optional nil if the data passed to be initialized is wrong</li>
   <li>Typecasting, as?, which is very helpful to make sure that the child object is the desired one</li>
</ul>
